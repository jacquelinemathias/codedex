# Create a fortune_cookie.py program that gives the user random fortunes.

# Define a function named fortune(). Inside the function, print out a random fortune from the list of options below:

#     Don't pursue happiness â€“ create it.
#     All things are difficult before they are easy.
#     The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.
#     Someone in your life needs a letter from you.
#     Don't just think. Act!
#     Your heart will skip a beat.
#     The fortune you search for is in another cookie.
#     Help! I'm being held prisoner in a Chinese bakery!

# Make sure to use the random module's random.randint() and an if/elif/else.

# Then, call the fortune() function three times and see what you get!
