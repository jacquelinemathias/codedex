# “Are we there yet?” is a phrase that has existed for as long as there are children, vehicles, and road trips.

# First, ask the user “Are we there yet?” using the input() function and store it in an answer variable.

# Then, use a while loop that asks the user “Are we there yet?” over and over again until they respond with a “Yes”.

resposta = input('A gente já chegou? ')

while resposta != ('Sim'):
  resposta = input('A gente já chegou? ')
