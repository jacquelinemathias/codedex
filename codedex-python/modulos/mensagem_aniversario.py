# Create a new file called bday_messages.py.

# Import the random module.

# Then, define a bday_messages list with the following items:

# 'Hope you have a very Happy Birthday! 🎈',
# 'It's your special day – get out there and celebrate! 🎉',
# 'You were born and the world got better – everybody wins! 🥳',
# 'Have lots of fun on your special day! 🎂',
# 'Another year of you going around the sun! 🌞'
# Next, use the random.choice() method to get a single item from the list.

# Save this item in a random_message variable.

# Let's save bday_messages.py and move to the next part.

import random

mensagens = ['Hope you have a very Happy Birthday! 🎈',
             "It's your special day – get out there and celebrate! 🎉", 
             'You were born and the world got better – everybody wins! 🥳', 
             'Have lots of fun on your special day! 🎂', 
             'Another year of you going around the sun! 🌞']

mensagem_aleatoria = random.choice()
