    <h1>A World Without Art</h1>
    <h3>May 15, 2000</h3>

    <p>To the Editor: <br> <br>

        If information pirates like Ian Clarke are allowed to have their way and destroy the copyright system (front page, May 10), what they will be left with is a new world bereft of any worthwhile art. What Mr. Clarke and others like him forget is that it is terribly expensive to create art, be it film, music or literature. <br> <br>
        
        If an artist (or the artist's financial supporter) has no way to recover the costs of producing art, then what will be the incentive to create it? The cost of publishing a novel or recording a song is beyond the means of most people. <br> <br>
        
        It is already difficult enough for independent artists to produce their art. Let's not shut them down for good.</p>
